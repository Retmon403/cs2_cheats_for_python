# 如何运行
 拥有Python 64bit环境  
你还需要[pip install ...] 一些关键模块  
1.pip install pymem  
2.pip install pywin32  
3.pip install ctypes  
4.pip install pyimgui   
5.pip install pyglet  
  
为什么要使用ImGui画窗口却用GDI绘制？  
咱老北京儿人没别的，您猜怎么着？诶，就是这一出~  
咱是易语言大手子， C++我不会:(  

Having a Python 64bit environment

You also need to [pip install...] some key modules

1. pip install pymem

2. pip install pywin32

3. pip install ctypes

4. pip install pyimgui

5. pip install pyglet



Why use ImGui to draw windows but use GDI to draw?

We from old Beijing have nothing else, guess what? Hey, that's this one~

We are experts in Yi language, and I don't know C++:（
# 更新日志

英语很烂，所以变量和函数命名比较随意，但代码逻辑还是很精简的  
1.很努力的优化gdi让他可以流畅的绘图而不会出现闪框  
2.加入了平滑自瞄,加入了自动更新offset  
3.优化了运行效率,修了一些bug  
还想加许多功能，但我担心Python跑起来太卡  

English is terrible, so variable and function names are quite casual, but the code logic is still very concise

1. He worked very hard to optimize GDI so that he could draw smoothly without flashing frames

2. Added smooth self aiming and automatic update offset

3. Optimized operational efficiency and fixed some bugs

I still want to add many functions, but I'm worried that Python will run too laggy
# 问题
你是不是想问我，运行起来为什么这么卡？  
答：用易语言就不会卡  

为什么不用c++，却用python？  
答：因为python写起来简单，代码量比c++少一万倍  

如何更新offset?  
答：main.py中 变量->UPDATE_OFFSET默认为TRUE 程序会自动更新偏移量  

How to update offset?

Answer: Variable ->UPDATE in main.py_ OFF SET defaults to true and the program will automatically update the offset
